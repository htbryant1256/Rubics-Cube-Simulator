# Rubics-Cube-Simulator

Fully simulated solvable rubics cube. 

Has a random shuffler to mix the rubics cube before solving. If you do not want to use the shuffler, when prompted type 0 (for 0 shuffling).

CONTROLS:
Select what side you would like to move with numpad 8,4,5,6, and 2. 
While holding a select key use WASD to move the side in that direction. 
Arrow keys are used to rotate the cube around to get a better view.
